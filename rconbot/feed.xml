                <p>The process by which the Mod Mail bot is used is pretty straight forward. Below I will illustrate the steps and flow for the bot and include screenshots the illustrate how it works from varying perspectives.</p>
<h2>User Messages Bot</h2>
<p>The bot works off of a 'Ticket' system, when a brand new user messages the Mod Mail bot a new ticket is created in the back-end. There is nothing the user has to do, this is to keep the barrier to entry very simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<address>Sidenote: Tickets have titles that should be updated by any mod or anybody reviewing existing tickets in order to make tickets easier to sort through as they age.</address>
<p>So the first step in the bot-user flow is a user messaging the bot.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//someone_reporting.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/someone_reporting-xs.png 300w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/someone_reporting-sm.png 480w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/someone_reporting-md.png 768w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/someone_reporting-lg.png 1024w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/someone_reporting-xl.png 1360w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/someone_reporting-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="452" height="74"></figure>
<p>This will be sent to the bot, then the bot will forward the details to a mod only accessible channel.</p>
<p>This is step two in the process.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//mod_mail_channel.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_channel-xs.png 300w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_channel-sm.png 480w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_channel-md.png 768w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_channel-lg.png 1024w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_channel-xl.png 1360w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_channel-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="662" height="361"></figure>
<p>Then a mod can respond via the $msg command and the bot will show the response in the channel, this is part of the step three bit of the process which involves any back and forth between the user and the moderator through the bot.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//mod_mail_response.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_response-xs.png 300w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_response-sm.png 480w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_response-md.png 768w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_response-lg.png 1024w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_response-xl.png 1360w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_response-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="659" height="376"></figure>
<p>Note that although we know which mod responded to the user, they do not know. This is probably to our advantage as it allows any mod to take over an exchange and an owner to be elevated if necessary into handling a user issue through the bot.</p>
<p>Here you can see the full exchange as it looks to the user thus far.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//mod_mail_follow_up.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_follow_up-xs.png 300w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_follow_up-sm.png 480w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_follow_up-md.png 768w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_follow_up-lg.png 1024w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_follow_up-xl.png 1360w ,https://arconianmoogly.github.io/rconbot/media/posts/2//responsive/mod_mail_follow_up-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="683" height="299"></figure>
<p>This can continue until a mod closes the ticket in the mod-mail channel by issuing the $close / $closeticket command.</p>
<p>Once the ticket is closed, mods cannot message a user through the bot until a user creates a new ticket. If a mod wishes to contact a user any further they should do it directly. This entire exchange is recorded to a database we fully control in order to give us total control of our data in the case where we may have to delete highly sensitive content that Discord themselves would not approve of being within our mod-mail channel.</p>
